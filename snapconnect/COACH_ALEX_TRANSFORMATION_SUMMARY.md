# Coach Alex Voice-to-Text Transformation Summary

## Project Overview
Transformed Coach Alex from a complex, unreliable voice coaching system into a streamlined, text-based AI coach that integrates seamlessly with the existing health infrastructure.

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

### 1. **Voice System Removal & Simplification**
- **Removed**: Complex voice recording, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech components
