# SnapConnect Ephemeral Discover Feed - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Feature Overview
The ephemeral discover feed works like Snapchat Stories - posts appear from other users and automatically disappear after being viewed for 2+ seconds. Once viewed, they never appear again for that user.

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY WORKING
- ✅ Posts auto-disappear after 2 seconds of viewing
- ✅ Posts never reappear once viewed
- ✅ Beautiful Instagram-like UI with user profiles
- ✅ Real fitness content with photos
- ✅ Database persistence of viewed posts
- ✅ Security features (screenshot detection)
- ✅ Performance optimized with virtualized lists

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables
posts              -- All user posts
post_views         -- Tracks which user viewed which post (ephemeral logic)  
users              -- User profiles with fitness levels

-- Key functions
get_unviewed_posts(user_id, limit, offset) -- Returns posts user hasn't viewed
batch_mark_viewed(user_id, view_records)   -- Marks posts as viewed
```

### Key Components
```
app/(tabs)/discover.tsx           -- Main discover screen
src/components/discover/
  ├── PostFeedCard.tsx           -- Individual post UI component
  ├── SimpleViewTracker.tsx      -- Timer-based view detection (WORKING)
  └── PostFeedOptimized.tsx      -- Performance optimized version
src/stores/discoverStore.ts      -- Zustand state management
src/services/postService.ts      -- Database queries
```

### State Flow
1. **Load Posts**: `getUnviewedPosts()` fetches posts user hasn't seen
2. **View Detection**: `SimpleViewTracker` starts 2s timer when post appears
3. **Mark Viewed**: After 2s, post marked in `post_views` table
4. **Remove from Feed**: Post disappears from local state
5. **Persist**: Database ensures post never appears again

## 🧪 Testing the Feature

### Method 1: Use Existing Test Data
If posts already exist, simply:
1. Open the app
2. Go to Discover tab
3. Watch posts auto-disappear after 2 seconds
4. Refresh - viewed posts won't reappear

### Method 2: Add Fresh Test Data
1. **Copy SQL script**: `/scripts/seedTestData.sql`
2. **Paste in Supabase SQL Editor**: [https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lubfyjzdfgpoocsswrkz/sql/new](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/lubfyjzdfgpoocsswrkz/sql/new)
3. **Run the script** - Creates 12+ fresh posts with realistic content
4. **Refresh discover feed** - New posts will appear
5. **Test ephemeral behavior** - Posts disappear after viewing

### Expected Behavior
- **Initial Load**: Shows "X new posts" in header
- **Auto-Viewing**: Posts disappear automatically after 2 seconds
- **Count Updates**: Header count decreases as posts are viewed
- **End State**: Shows "All caught up!" when no posts remain
- **Persistence**: Refreshing won't bring back viewed posts

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### View Detection Logic (SimpleViewTracker)
```typescript
// Timer-based approach (WORKING)
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    onViewed(postId, duration);
  }, 2000); // 2s for photos, 3s for videos
  
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, []);
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Get unviewed posts for user
SELECT p.*, u.username, u.fitness_level, u.avatar_url
FROM posts p
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id  
LEFT JOIN post_views pv ON p.id = pv.post_id AND pv.user_id = $user_id
WHERE p.user_id != $user_id AND pv.id IS NULL
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;

-- Mark post as viewed
INSERT INTO post_views (user_id, post_id, viewed_at)
VALUES ($user_id, $post_id, now())
ON CONFLICT (user_id, post_id) DO NOTHING;
```

### State Management (Zustand)
```typescript
const useDiscoverStore = create((set, get) => ({
  posts: [],
  viewedPostIds: new Set(),
  
  markPostAsViewed: (postId) => {
    // Optimistic update - immediately remove from UI
    set(state => ({
      viewedPostIds: new Set([...state.viewedPostIds, postId])
    }));
    // Then sync to database
  }
}));
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Debug Logs to Watch For
When testing, look for this log sequence:
```
🎯 DISCOVER: Rendering post [id] - scroll velocity: 0
⏰ SIMPLE: Starting 2000ms timer for [id]  
✅ SIMPLE: [id] viewed for 2000ms - triggering callback
🔥 POSTCARD: Post [id] viewed for 2000ms
🎯 DISCOVER: Post [id] viewed - adding to queue
👁️ Marking post [id] as viewed (optimistic)
📊 X unviewed posts out of Y total
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: Posts not disappearing
- **Check**: Look for `⏰ SIMPLE:` logs - if missing, SimpleViewTracker isn't working
- **Fix**: Ensure `enabled={true}` and `debug={true}` on SimpleViewTracker

**Issue**: Posts reappearing after refresh  
- **Check**: Database errors in logs
- **Fix**: Run the `fix_session_id.sql` script to fix schema

**Issue**: No posts showing
- **Check**: User has posts to view
- **Fix**: Run `seedTestData.sql` to create fresh content

**Issue**: All posts viewed too quickly
- **Check**: All timers firing simultaneously  
- **Expected**: This is normal behavior - all visible posts start timers

## 🚀 Extending the Feature
