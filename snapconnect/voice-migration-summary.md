# SnapConnect Voice Coaching Migration Summary
**Coach Alex Voice Integration with Pypecat AI Framework**

## 🎯 Project Goal
Migrate from basic voice coaching to a sophisticated WordWise AI-inspired voice system using Pypecat, Deepgram STT, OpenAI LLM, and ElevenLabs TTS for natural conversational voice coaching.

## ✅ Completed Work

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Created `voice-service/` directory with Python virtual environment
- ✅ Installed Pypecat AI framework with all dependencies
- ✅ Configured environment variables for APIs (Deepgram, ElevenLabs, OpenAI)
- ✅ Enhanced database schema with voice coaching tables and functions

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- ✅ Built complete Pypecat voice pipeline (`voice-service/main.py`)
- ✅ Implemented WebSocket server on localhost:8002
- ✅ Created comprehensive debug logging system
- ✅ Fixed all import and API compatibility issues
- ✅ Successfully tested Python service startup

### Phase 3: React Native Integration
- ✅ Created phone call-style UI components:
  - `VoiceCallInterface.tsx` - Full-screen voice call experience
  - `CoachCallButton.tsx` - One-tap call initiation
- ✅ Integrated natural conversation interface into coach tab
- ✅ Fixed React Native compatibility issues (window.addEventListener, imports)
- ✅ Created `pychatVoiceService.ts` for WebSocket communication

### Phase 4: Database & Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed database migration column reference errors
- ✅ Applied migration `030_fix_voice_coaching_user_goals.sql`
- ✅ Resolved user_goals table column mismatches

## 🔧 Key Technical Components

### Python Voice Service (`voice-service/main.py`)
```python
# Real-time pipeline: WebSocket → Deepgram STT → OpenAI GPT → ElevenLabs TTS → WebSocket
- Handles Coach Alex personality and fitness prompts
- Runs on localhost:8002 with comprehensive logging
- Uses Pipecat framework for seamless audio streaming
```

### React Native Voice Interface
```typescript
// Phone call style UI with automatic conversation flow
- VoiceCallInterface: Full-screen call experience
- CoachCallButton: Simple integration component  
- Natural conversation without button pressing
- Hands-free interaction with Voice Activity Detection
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Enhanced tables for voice coaching
- voice_coaching_sessions: WebSocket session tracking
- voice_coaching_commands: Voice command processing
- Enhanced coach_conversations: Voice context integration
```

## 🎮 Current Status
- **Python Service**: ✅ Running successfully on localhost:8002
- **Database**: ✅ All migrations applied and fixed
- **UI Components**: ✅ Integrated into coach tab
- **WebSocket Connection**: 🟡 Ready for testing

## 🚀 Next Steps (For New Chat Session)

### Immediate Priority
1. **Test Complete Voice Pipeline**
   - Start Python service: `cd voice-service && python main.py`
   - Test voice call button in coach tab
   - Verify WebSocket connection and audio streaming
