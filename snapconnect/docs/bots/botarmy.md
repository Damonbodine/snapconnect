## BOT ARMY INSTRUCTIONS
Excellent! Everything is set up perfectly. Here's your complete AI bot automation
   system ready for tomorrow:

  ðŸ¤– TOMORROW'S BOT ARMY PLAN

  Quick Commands (added to package.json):

  npm run bot:schedule    # Check daily status
  npm run bot:army        # Run all 70 bots 
  npm run bot:test        # System health check

  For Tomorrow Morning:

  1. Check Status (see how many posted):
  npm run bot:schedule
  2. Preview All 70 Users (safe dry-run):
  npm run bot:army -- --dry-run
  3. Launch Full Bot Army (all 70 users):
  npm run bot:army

  What Will Happen:

  âœ… 70 AI users will create authentic fitness postsâœ… 5 content types rotated
  intelligently: workout_post, progress_update, motivation, education, socialâœ…
  GPT-4o captions + GPT-Image-1 images (low quality for cost optimization)âœ… Batch 
  processing (5 users at a time with delays)âœ… 24-hour expiry on all posts
  (ephemeral content)âœ… Smart archetype variation (fitness_newbie,
  strength_warrior, etc.)

  Safety Features:

  - Uses migration functions to avoid duplicate posts
  - Rate limiting with delays between requests
  - Error handling and retry logic
  - Dry-run mode for testing
  - Batch processing to avoid overwhelming APIs

  Your bot army is locked and loaded for tomorrow! ðŸš€
