## ðŸš€ Implementation Approach

### Recommended Implementation Path

1. **Start with Official SDK** (Week 1-2)
   - Use patterns from [Document 5](./05-agora-official-react-native-docs.md)
   - Follow integration strategy from [Document 7](./07-snapconnect-integration-strategy.md)
   - Implement core services and authentication

2. **Leverage Existing Patterns** (Week 2-3)
   - Follow SnapConnect's established patterns (Zustand, Supabase, components)
   - Extend existing camera and events systems
   - Maintain UI/UX consistency

3. **Optimize for Scale** (Week 3-4)
   - Implement cost optimization strategies from [Document 6](./06-agora-pricing-analysis.md)
   - Add performance monitoring and quality controls
   - Prepare for production deployment

### Alternative Paths

- **App Builder Route**: If rapid prototyping is priority, start with [Document 1](./01-agora-app-builder-analysis.md) approach
- **Custom Implementation**: For maximum control, combine patterns from [Documents 3-5](./03-ios-live-streaming-implementation.md)

## ðŸ’¡ Key Decision Points

### 1. App Builder vs SDK
- **App Builder**: Faster development, less control
- **Raw SDK**: More control, longer development time
- **Recommendation**: Start with SDK for production flexibility

### 2. Integration Depth
- **Shallow**: Embed streaming in dedicated screens
- **Deep**: Full integration with existing SnapConnect features
- **Recommendation**: Deep integration following [Document 7](./07-snapconnect-integration-strategy.md)

### 3. Feature Scope
- **MVP**: Basic host/viewer streaming
- **Full**: Co-host, AR filters, events integration
- **Recommendation**: Progressive implementation starting with MVP

## ðŸ“Š Cost Considerations

Based on [pricing analysis](./06-agora-pricing-analysis.md):

- **Free Tier**: 10,000 minutes/month (good for MVP testing)
- **Growth Phase**: $2,000-10,000/month (1K-10K users)
- **Scale Phase**: $50,000+/month (10K+ users with optimization)

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Dynamic video quality based on content type
- Stream duration limits by user tier
- Viewer count management
- Premium monetization to offset costs
