## What is Agora App Builder?

Agora App Builder is a low-code platform that provides pre-built video/audio communication components with extensive customization capabilities. For SnapConnect, this could accelerate development while maintaining UI/UX control.

## Key Implementation Insights

### 1. Customization Architecture
```typescript
// App Builder uses a customize() method for component overrides
customize({
  components: {
    // Override default UI components
    videocall: CustomVideoCallInterface,
    chat: CustomChatComponent,
  },
  config: {
    // Configuration overrides
    CHANNEL_PROFILE: 'LIVE_BROADCASTING'
  }
});
```

### 2. Integration Approach for SnapConnect
**Recommended Path**: Use Agora App Builder as foundation, heavily customize UI to match SnapConnect design.

**Why This Works for SnapConnect:**
- Your existing gradient-based design system can override App Builder's default UI
- Customization API allows complete component replacement
- Faster development than building from scratch with raw Agora SDK

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
```bash
# Install App Builder
npm install agora-app-builder
```

### Phase 2: UI Customization
```typescript
// src/services/agoraAppBuilderConfig.ts
export const snapConnectCustomization = {
  components: {
    // Replace video interface with SnapConnect-styled components
    videoCall: SnapConnectStreamInterface,
    participantList: SnapConnectParticipantList,
    controls: SnapConnectStreamControls,
  },
  theme: {
    // Apply SnapConnect gradient theme
    primaryColor: '#7C3AED',
    secondaryColor: '#EC4899',
    backgroundColor: '#000000',
  }
};
```

### Phase 3: Authentication Integration
```typescript
// Integration with existing Supabase auth
const initializeAppBuilder = async () => {
  const { user } = useAuthStore.getState();
  
  // Configure App Builder with SnapConnect user context
  await AppBuilder.initialize({
    appId: process.env.AGORA_APP_ID,
    channel: generateChannelId(),
    uid: user.id,
    // Custom authentication via Supabase
    token: await generateAgoraToken(user.id, 'host'),
  });
};
```

## Advantages for SnapConnect

### 1. Rapid Development
- Pre-built streaming infrastructure
- Real-time communication handled
- Focus on UI/UX customization rather than WebRTC complexity

### 2. Production Ready
- Battle-tested streaming technology
- Automatic scaling and optimization
- Built-in error handling and reconnection

### 3. Customization Depth
- Complete UI override capability
- Integration with existing state management (Zustand)
- Maintain SnapConnect's design language

## Implementation Challenges

### 1. Learning Curve
- Understanding App Builder's customization API
- Mapping SnapConnect's component patterns to App Builder structure

### 2. Dependency Management
- App Builder adds significant bundle size
- Potential conflicts with existing React Native dependencies

### 3. Customization Limitations
- Some deep customizations may require raw SDK approach
- Need to validate all SnapConnect features are possible

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Proof of Concept
```typescript
// Create minimal integration test
// src/screens/AppBuilderTestScreen.tsx
import AppBuilder from 'agora-app-builder';

export const TestLiveStreaming = () => {
  return (
    <AppBuilder
      customize={snapConnectCustomization}
      config={{
        channel: 'test-channel',
        appId: process.env.AGORA_APP_ID,
        // Test with SnapConnect user
      }}
    />
  );
};
```

### 2. Design System Integration
- Create wrapper components that translate SnapConnect design to App Builder
- Test gradient system compatibility
- Validate AR filter integration possibilities

### 3. Authentication Flow Testing
- Test Supabase auth integration
- Validate token generation and refresh
- Ensure user permissions carry over

## Alternative Consideration

**If App Builder proves too restrictive**: Fall back to raw Agora RTC SDK implementation as outlined in the main livestreaming plan. App Builder evaluation should take 1-2 days maximum before deciding on approach.

## Key Files to Create

```

## Decision Matrix

| Factor | App Builder | Raw SDK |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Development Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐|
| Customization Control | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Bundle Size | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Learning Curve | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Long-term Maintenance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Recommendation**: Start with App Builder for rapid prototyping, be prepared to migrate to raw SDK if customization requirements exceed App Builder capabilities.
