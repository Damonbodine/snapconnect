## üß† Notes for AI Agent (Claude)

- Use clean React Native component structure.
- Build screen flows modularly.
- Use placeholder assets (e.g., dummy snaps).
- Prioritize **Camera ‚Üí Story Sharing ‚Üí Feed ‚Üí Messaging** as MVP.
- Add conditional logic for disappearing messages/snaps.
- Use Supabase row-level security (RLS) for storing private snaps/messages.
- Handle onboarding flow with async storage or Supabase flags.

---

## ‚ùì Open Decisions (Claude can help!)

- Should story snaps be archived after expiry?
- Should camera filters be built in or use external lib?
- Do we build streak logic now or post-MVP?
